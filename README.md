- 🟣 I love to code and problem solve. I learn both bottom-up and top-down, a.k.a. from math and algorithms to using AI's directly as agents and direct efforts to deploy them, for my two latest projects on that check out [Type Like You](https://github.com/mtaruno/type-like-you) and my fork of SWE-Agent where I am creating my own agent functions: [SWE-Agent-CodeGeeX](https://github.com/mtaruno/SWE-Agent-codegeex).
