<h3 align="center">Stuff I Built</h3>

**Note:** _You can see the code I wrote for these projects below (which is probably pinned, if not in one of my repositories)_

1. [`Bioinformatic Research Replication and Extension`](https://github.com/jdahhan/Stem-Away-group-5) _June - August 2021_\
•	Leading a team as a core code contributor, project manager, and orator in replicating and extending the bioinformatic research of Percha and Altman 2015 titled “Learning the Structure of Biomedical Relationships from Unstructured Text”\
•	Parsed XML from Medline and DrugBank to leverage distributional semantics for efficiently proposing novel drug-gene relationships (cost of developing new drug is $3-10 billion) using tools like the Stanford parser and biclustering algorithms

2. [`EVE Bot`](https://github.com/mtaruno/eve-bot) _August 2020_ \
•	Built a Twitter Apple Support chatbot leveraging NLP techniques such as named entity recognition and document embeddings on Twitter data and a Bidirectional LSTM in Python to classify intents and deployed using Streamlit\
•	Wrote a [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-building-a-chatbot-with-spacy-and-deep-learning-d18811465876) that contains a video demo and goes in depth on the technical and practical workings of this project

3. [`Research Project: Data Literacy Research`](https://github.com/mtaruno/data-literacy-research) _Jan 2021 - Present_ \
•	Authoring and engineering a useful metric for the data literacy expectations of job recruiters that leverages text mining, topic modelling, and supervised learning techniques on a corpus scraped from LinkedIn using Selenium with Sandra Cannon

4. [`Vnomics DPF Failure Prediction`](https://github.com/mtaruno/Vnomics) _Jan - May 2021_ \
•	Built autoencoder models with ML Flow and Keras to predict truck failures given sensor data for a fuel optimization startup called Vnomics as my capstone project; the model is optimized by comprehensive time series feature engineering with TS Fresh to achieve a high recall score of over 80% on unseen data
