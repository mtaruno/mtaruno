- 🟣 I'm continuously learning: Machine Learning Engineering, Financial Literacy (Markets and Financial Math), and Entrepeneurship (Value Creation)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (other than ML) Android Development, Chinese, Music Production, Chess, Table Tennis
- 💬 Ask me about `how AI is changing the world`, `Machine Learning in Production`, the `Why I Love Data Science and Tech`, and `Python Best Practices`

<h3 align="center">Stuff I Built</h3>
Note: You can see the code I wrote for these projects below (which is probably pinned, if not in one of my repositories)

`EVE Bot`\
•	Built a Twitter Apple Support chatbot leveraging NLP techniques such as named entity recognition and document embeddings on Twitter data and a Bidirectional LSTM in Python to classify intents and deployed using Streamlit\
•	Wrote a Medium article that contains a video demo and goes in depth on the technical and practical workings of this project\

`Bioinformatic Research on Learning the Structure of Biomedical Relationships from Unstructured text`\
•	Leading a team as a core code contributor, project manager, and orator in replicating and extending the bioinformatic research of Percha and Altman 2015 titled “Learning the Structure of Biomedical Relationships from Unstructured Text”\
•	Parsed XML from Medline and DrugBank to leverage distributional semantics for efficiently proposing novel drug-gene relationships (cost of developing new drug is $3-10 billion) using tools like the Stanford parser and biclustering algorithms

`Research Project: Data Literacy Research`\
•	Authoring and engineering a useful metric for the data literacy expectations of job recruiters that leverages text mining, topic modelling, and supervised learning techniques on a corpus scraped from LinkedIn using Selenium with Sandra Cannon
